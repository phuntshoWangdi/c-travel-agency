Its origins are tied to a fascinating legend: Ngagi Wangchuk, while meditating in Timula, arrived at the present location in search of a winter seat. A deity appeared to him in the form of a white bleating goat, and he took the bleat as an auspicious sign. In 1552, he built a temple at the site, naming it Leyley Dzong, meaning "Fortress of the Goat."

The monastery’s history traces back even further to 1543, when it was originally established by Kuenga Wanpo, the son of the revered treasure discoverer Pema Lingpa. However, it wasn’t until 1654 that Minjur Tenpa, the Trongsa Penlop (governor), built formal Dzong after winning a significant battle, renaming it Lhuentse Rinchentse.

Today, the cave still bears giant imprints believed to be those of Guru Rinpoche and the struggling demon. The name Gomphu meaning “sacred meditation” and Kora meaning “circumambulation.”
