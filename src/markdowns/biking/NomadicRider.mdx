A deity appeared to him in the form of a white bleating goat, and he took the bleat as an auspicious sign. In 1552, he built a temple at the site, naming it Leyley Dzong, meaning "Fortress of the Goat."

The monastery’s history traces back even further to 1543, when it was originally established by Kuenga Wanpo, the son of the revered treasure discoverer Pema Lingpa. However, it wasn’t until 1654 that Minjur Tenpa, the Trongsa Penlop (governor), built formal Dzong after winning a significant battle, renaming it Lhuentse Rinchentse.
