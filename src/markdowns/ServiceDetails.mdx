**Peak Seasons:** March, April, May, September, October and November.

**Lean Seasons:** December, January, February, June, July and August.

We highly recommend confirming your trip to Bhutan as early as possible, especially during peak seasons. Securing hotel rooms and flight seats in advance is essential, as they tend to sell out 5 to 6 months before arrival. Booking early ensures a smooth and hassle-free travel experience.
