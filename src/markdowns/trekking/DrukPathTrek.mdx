# Druk Path Trek

## 9 Day /8 Nights

#### DAY 1: Arrival at Paro

The flight to Paro is considered one of the most spectacular and thrilling flights in the world. Here’s why, on clear days, you can see Mt. Everest, Kanchenjunga, Makalu, and Bhutan’s highest peak, Gangkar Puensum**.** The descent offers breathtaking views of green valleys, monasteries, and rivers.\*\*

Upon your arrival, you will be greeted by your travel companion with a _khadar_ (white scarf) as a symbol of blessings and goodwill. Then drive to your hotel/resort and rest for some time. After your short rest get refreshed and visit:

**Ta Dzong – The National Museum of Bhutan:** Perched high above the iconic Rinpung Dzong, _Ta Dzong_ (meaning "watchtower") offers a fascinating glimpse into Bhutan's rich history and culture. Originally built in 1649 by Tenzin Drugdra, the first Paro Penlop (governor), it was later transformed into the National Museum of Bhutan in 1968 under the command of His Majesty Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, the third King of Bhutan. Though severely damaged by the 2011 earthquake, meticulous restoration work was completed in 2019. On June 24, 2020, the fully restored museum reopened to the public, offering a breathtaking collection of Bhutanese art, artifacts, and cultural treasures.

**Rinpung Dzong – Fortress on a Heap of Jewels:** Rinpung Dzong, meaning "Fortress on a Heap of Jewels," stands as a magnificent symbol of Bhutan’s spiritual and administrative heritage. In 15<sup>th</sup> century local people offered the crag of Hungrel to Lama Drung Drung Gyal, later Lama Drung Drung Gyal built a small temple there and later a five storied Dzong which was known as Hungrel Dzong. In 1644, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the unifier of Bhutan, dismantled the existing structure and built the present-day Rinpung Dzong in 1646. Since then, it has served as the monastic and administrative center of Paro Dzongkhag. Notably, some scenes from the 1993 film _Little Buddha_ were shot within this historic fortress. Overnight at hotel/resort in Paro.

#### DAY 2: Acclimatization Hike to Tiger’s Nest

Today we will hike to most iconic and must visit site of Bhutan, Tiger’s Nest.

**Tiger’s Nest:** Early in the morning, after a hearty breakfast, we will drive to the base camp of Tiger’s Nest Monastery, a journey of approximately 30 minutes from Paro town. From there, we embark on the iconic hike to Taktsang Monastery, famously known as "Tiger’s Nest." Perched dramatically on a sheer cliff at an elevation of 3,120 meters above sea level, this monastery is Bhutan’s most iconic landmark and spiritual treasure. No trip to Bhutan is complete without visiting this remarkable centuries-old heritage site.

The trek to Taktsang is both challenging and rewarding. For those who prefer a less strenuous ascent, horseback rides are available up to the halfway point, known as the cafeteria. However, the most fulfilling part of this journey is completing the hike on foot, which takes approximately five hours round-trip. As you ascend, you’ll be captivated by breathtaking views and the spiritual ambiance of this sacred site. The name "Taktsang" translates to "Tiger’s Nest," rooted in the legend that Guru Rinpoche flew to this location on the back of a tigress to meditate. The original temple was built in 1508 by Lam Sonam Gyeltshen, a devoted disciple of Guru Rinpoche and named it as Taktsang. Overnight at hotel/resort in Paro.
